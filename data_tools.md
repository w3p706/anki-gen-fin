To use this script, you'll need to run it from the command line. Here are examples of how to invoke each command:

- For migrating data:
  ```
  python script_name.py migrate-data
  ```
- For computing statistics:
  ```
  python script_name.py stats
  ```
- For converting a VTT file to CSV:
  ```

Make sure to replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script. Also, ensure that the `ankigenfin` module and its functions are correctly implemented and accessible by this script.
